Hi all,  
<!--more-->
I'm currently an undergraduate final year student of computer science with plans of entering the field of developing neurotechnology and working with neural networks to make predictions about the patterns within a brain subject to neurodegeneration.  
<!--more-->
My broad interests include playing puzzle-based action-adventure RPGs such as video games from the Legend of Zelda series, going rock climbing with my friends and watching video essays on YouTube on a variety of subjects spanning between the inner-workings of home appliances from the channel 'Technology Connections' and reviews on legacy sound system hardware from the channel 'DankPods'.

I also love exploring new creative outlets and rediscovering old ones, I will periodically pick back up my pencil and a sheet of paper with the ambition of visually exploring a concept, or I'll buy a ball of wool and knit something, however this is far from being a sustained aspect of my life as of right now.

My main ambition for this website is to host a portfolio of not only software creations but also to publicly document my progress with a manner of projects, whether it be a sketch I'm working on or a climb that I'm in the process of solving.

Thanks for reading this introductory post!
